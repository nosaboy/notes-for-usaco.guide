# Structure
## Usage
- How is the DSA(basic usage) 
- Time and Space Complexity
- What types of problems can it solve(expanding usage)
- Tips and Mistakes about DSA from experience

## Basic implementation & Examples
- Usage for example problems
- Decribe implementation(what is it trying to achieve)
- Code & comments

## Problems
- Time(Stopwatch from reading problem to AC)
- Simplifed Problem Statement(What are we trying to do)
- Thought process & self written editorial
- AC Code(inside void solve()) & comments
### Reflection - Reviewing Problem Editorial
- What mistakes were made
  - What differs from editorial
  - What Wasted Time
  - Error in thought process
  - Error in implementation
  - Alternative solution?

### Starting

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
typedef vector <int> vi;
typedef pair<int,int> pi;
#define pb push_back
#define rep(i,a,b) for(int i = a; i<(b);i++)


int main(){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);

    return 0;
}
```
