### Usage
- Connectivity: can two nodes reach each other? # of connected components?
Run a for loop for each node not visited yet, run dfs through that node and mark all of them visited, increase the number of connected components by 1.
- Finding cycles
   - directly: run dfs through some node, it weuriare at a node and we already visited a neighbouring node that is **not its parent**, this means that thre contains a cycle from that node to current node.
