- A connected graph is a graph of vertices such that each vertex can reach every other vertex using undirected edges.
- Spanning tree: set of edges that forms a tree and contains every vertex in the original graph
- Minimum spanning tree: Spanning tree such that the sum of edge weights are minimized
