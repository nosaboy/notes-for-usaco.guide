### Divisors and Divisibility(Introduction to Number Theory)
- NT restricts the number of solutions in a set of possibilities
A set under an operation is closed if for any two elements of the set under that operation, you always get another element in the set.
- Example: set of integers is closed under operations +,-,*, but not under /

Example 5: How many unordered pairs of positive integers({1,2} = {2,1}) that sum up to 2000 and are coprime?

Note that if two integers a and b are no coprime, they have some common factor c. So we have a = cx, b = cy, so a + b = c(x+y) = 2000. Thus c is a factor of 2000. So if {a,b} satisifies if a and b don't share some factor of 2000. We know that if a does not have any factors in 2000, then b doesn't have any factors of 2000 either. Thus we have values of a can be phi(2000) = 800. It is unordered pairs so answer is 400.

Given prime factorization:
$$
n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}...p_n^{a_b}
$$
