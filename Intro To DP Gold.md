### Usage
Uses the idea of brute force + greedy to divide and store problems into subproblems to solve original problem(like recursion).
- Find optimal solution
- Find number of solutions

Sometimes we can **write a slower brute forcy solution** in order to:
- get a better understanding on how to optimize dp & details
- earn partial credit
- generate stress tests

For each dp problem, we need 
- base case
- transition step
