### Usage
- Subset states can be stored as integers using bits
- Optimal selection: Given the prices of n products over m days(2d array of integers), we want to buy each product exactly once(n <= m) and buy at most one product a day. What is the minimum total price
  - brute foce: O(2^(nk)), since we go through every possibility
  - DP: Let $dp[]
