Residue Class - Two numbers a and b are in the same residue mod n if $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$
#### Mod properties
In mod, we can take any number and replace it with another number in the same residue class.
Let a and b be in the same residue class, c and d be in the same residue class, then
$a+c \equiv b+d \pmod{n}$ and $ac \equiv bd$ since they will be the same numbers mod n.

Example 5:
If we are asked for the last n digits, we can try to find a 11 or 9 mod 10^k, tjhen use **binomial expansion** to cancel out all
